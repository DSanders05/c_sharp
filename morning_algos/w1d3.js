// Remove duplicates
// Given a sorted array of integers, remove all duplicates from the array and return an array that does not contain duplicates (okay to make a new array)

// Ex: given [1,1,1,2,3,3,4] > return [1,2,3,4]
// Ex: given [2,2,3,4,4,4] > return [2,3,4]

// Challenge one: How would you do this with an unsorted array?
// Challenge two: try to do this WITHOUT making a new array! (Also known as in place)

const removeDuplicate = (arr)=>{

}

removeDuplicate([1,1,1,2,3,3,4])
